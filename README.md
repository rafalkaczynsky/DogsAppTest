Some my thoughts and comments:

1. As there was mantioned that there is some freedom around the implementioned I've added some basic 
UI improvements to the Screen Shots provided (mainly paddings to make it looks a little bit better). Can still remove them if you want to :) 

2. I can see also that on the Screen Shots is used default header component from react-navigation however I've 
decided to create my own that looks like the default one but gives us a little bit more freedom and control over UI, (like make it looks the same 
on both platforms. Default header doesn't look the same for android and ios, and one of the creteria was keep the apps design the same on both. 

3. There is aslo - "...text at the users prefered magnification..." for this puprose only I've added a Settings Icon that is taking us to 
settings screen where you can increase, decrise base app fontsize. I hope I didn't misunderstand this one :). In real life the settings button I will 
place somewhere else like in bottom tab bar, or drawer but I decided to go this just for presentation puproses only as it doesn't make sense to me creating
bottom tab bar with one tab.

4. Fetching additional images can sometimes when on sub breed screen on refresh fetching new 

5. I've Used some third party packages but not to many, like react-native-fast-image for in my opinion awasome caching api puprose for persiting data between
session have used redux-persist library as it works perfectly in my opinion in the redux store configuration I've used in this app. 

6. I did my best on the weekend and hope you like it but if not please give me some comments as never to late for learing new/missed staff.
